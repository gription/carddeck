    Great experience.  Learned so much, but..
        - 'Discovered' depth of game mechanics. I wonder if ANYONE has EVER
            underestimated a programming projects' complexity before?
        - Mistakenly(?) looked into others efforts and was encouraged to see so
            many of my ideas were consistent with the approaches of my betters.
            However, the implementation requirements of those ideas (such as
            bitwise hand scoring) so exceed any affection I have for the final
            project completion..
        - Final straw; I've learned more about how Go passes slices by reference
            (vs value) & I'm drawn towards refactoring with equal passion as
            I am towards marching bravely forward with blinders on.
        - I'd rather leave, excited to start another with newfound knowledge,
            than turn this whole experience into trench warfare, or allow
            the unterminated todo to weigh on my conscience as TBD.
        - Perhaps in consolation, I'm very happy with the progress made in
            the periphery: IDE config, extensions found, debugging, testing,
            AI integration (Models/Weights/RAG/TAG/Prompts/Params), logging,
            git workflow, linting configuration, the Go environment (vars,
            file structure, modules, documentation, testing ++), etc.
            KEEP: .golangci.yaml, .gitignore, .gitattributes, and .editorconfig
        - Lastly, I suspect my future self (assuming I progress at all(?)) will
            above all be embarassed by my commenting. I leave those comments,
            well all of this, simply for my ancestors to more easily mock me in
            their seat of superiority. To you.. I send my warmest regards.
